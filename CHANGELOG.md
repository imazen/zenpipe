## zenpipe

### [Unreleased]

#### Fixed

- **Gain-map sidecars resample in encoded space** (#41, b938a2b0): sidecar
  pixels are log2-quantized gain values, not color — Skia's SkGainmapShader
  and libultrahdr interpolate them raw. The decode path now labels sidecar
  strips `TransferFunction::Linear`; `NodeOp::Layout` derives its working
  format from the source transfer (`RGBA8_LINEAR` for Linear sources, so
  zenresize does raw u8↔f32 with no gamma round-trip); `ResizeSource`
  carries the working format instead of hardcoding `RGBA8_SRGB`. Previously
  resized Preserve jobs bounced gain values through the sRGB EOTF/OETF.
- **Gain-map re-embed repacks the materialized sidecar** (#41, b938a2b0):
  tight 1-/3-channel packing driven by ISO 21496-1
  `GainMapParams::is_single_channel()` (metadata-driven, not pixel
  inspection), fixing the latent corruption where a resized RGBA sidecar
  was re-embedded as raw RGBA bytes labeled `channels: 3`.

## zencodecs

### [Unreleased]

#### Fixed

- **UltraHDR encode derives the color gamut from CICP metadata** (#40):
  `encode_ultrahdr_rgb_f32` / `encode_ultrahdr_rgba_f32` previously ignored
  their metadata parameter and hardcoded BT.709. CICP color primaries 1/2 →
  BT.709, 12 → Display P3, 9 → BT.2100; an explicit code outside the three
  UltraHDR gamuts is an encode error (`UnsupportedOperation`) rather than a
  silent BT.709 fallback, which would compute wrong gain-map luma.
